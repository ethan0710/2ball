# 2ball
Numerical simulations about the trajectory of two balls which connected by a spring.

main.py            --> Processing the numerical simulation program.\\
initialization.py  --> Input the initial condition and some setting.\\
animation.py       --> Create the .mp4 file for watching.\\
visualization.py   --> Create the .png file for looking the trajectory of the two balls.\\
physics.py         --> The functions which using in the program.\\
